## ESP32 PH/EC SHIELD

This Project is going to be the a SHIELD for a ESP32 Devkit Board. 

The Board will find it's pospose in the Aquaristics, Grow and Aquaponics area. It will be able to messure water quality of sweetwater systems and contoll pumps, leds and whatsoever over a webserver.
Also there will be an integration for IR and RF transmitter/receiver to contoll externel diveces such as 433Mhz power sockets and IR controlled LED lights.


The board will mainly be controlled over a wifi enabled websever, but it will also have a Text Display with a rotary encoder for basic controlls.
